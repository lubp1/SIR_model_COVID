# SIR Model to COVID19
This is an project for a Linear Systems Analysis undergraduate course, whose objective is to model the coronavirus spread on Brazil using the SIR disease spread model. The data used on this project can be found on https://github.com/pdpcosta/COVID-19_Brazil.

The first part of the project was to model the disease spread with a logistic function, and find its parameters with avaliable data.  The analysis made can be found on the report1.pdf file, in portuguese.

The second part of the project was to model the disease spread with the continuous time SIR model, fitting its parameters to the known data. The analysis made can be found on the report2.pdf file, in portuguese.
