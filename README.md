# SI_model_COVID
This is an project for a Linear Systems Analysis undergraduate course, whose objective is to model the coronavirus spread on Brazil using the SI disease spread model. This leads to a logistic function for the number of infected people, and it's parameters should be estimated. The data used on this project can be found on https://github.com/pdpcosta/COVID-19_Brazil. The analysis made can be found on the report.pdf file, in portuguese.
